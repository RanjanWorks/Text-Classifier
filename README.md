# Text-Classifier

Text classifiers that can tell the answer in positive and negative are typically trained on a large corpus of text that has been labeled with sentiment.
This corpus of text can be made up of product reviews, customer feedback, social media posts, and other forms of text that express opinions. 
The text classifier learns to identify the words and phrases that are associated with positive and negative sentiment
